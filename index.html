    <h1>Hello Everyone! I am Mila.</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Mila Scardigno and I enjoy planting, learning about self
      development topics and how to help our environment and animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find parrots fascinating as they can be very funny and teach us so much
      about behavioral science and whenever I am not doing something for school,
      I enjoy Nintendo video games.
    </p>
    <h2>My Pets</h2>
    <p>Among some of the pets I care for at home are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>14 Chickens</li>
      <li>2 Dogs</li>
      <li>3 Parrots</li>
      <ol>
        <li>A cockatiel</li>
        <li>An eclectus</li>
        <li>An amazon</li>
      </ol>
      <li>1 bunny</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I am currently learning how to code and I am loving it! I am also learning
      how to use GitHub and <strong>ASP.NET and C#</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are so many concepts and I am excited to learn more and more as time
      goes and as my <em>lower back allows</em>.
    </p>
