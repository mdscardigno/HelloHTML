      My name is Mila Scardigno and I am a former web developer who is now
      learning additional skills to explore the potential opportunities learning
      code and UI/UX could bring in the near future. I enjoy meeting people with
      common objectives and exchanging knowledge to achieve a mutual learning
      experience and the satisfaction of helping each other achieve a particular
      or common goal or goals. <br /><br />During my free time, I enjoy
      planting, learning about self development topics to improve my
      interpersonal relationships, communication, life and emotional skills, to
      name a few.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my family cooking was such a rewarding experience so, I grew up
      passionate about cooking and exploring different recipes to learn about
      different foods, their culture, tastes and health benefits. My favorite is
      making pasta because it is as if one is playing with PlayDough and it
      feels so good when one cooks pasta from scratch and not to mention the
      taste!.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, I indulge my curiosity learning about origin of certain
      animals, plants, and other things, and how to contribute to the
      conservation of our environment despite the challenges we face.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the animals I love besides dogs and capybaras are parrots. I find
      parrots fascinating as they can be very funny and teach us so much about
      behavioral science. <br /><br />Whenever I am not doing something for
      school, I enjoy Nintendo video games and greek mythology.

      I am currently learning how to code and I am loving it! I am also learning
      how to use GitHub and <strong>ASP.NET and C#</strong>.

    <p>
      There are so many concepts and I am excited to learn more and more as time
      goes and as my <em>lower back allows</em>.

    <p>See ya soon!</p>
